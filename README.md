# simporo - stay focused!

A simple pomodoro app based on React. It is based on the pomodoro technique, a time management method which uses a timer to break a task into several shorter sessions, with breaks in between. 

It was developed by Francesco Cirillo in 1980s, a student who used to use a tomato shaped kitchen timer, hence, the name _pomodoro_, the Italian word for tomato.

In this app, it uses the traditional 25 minutes interval for work time, 5 minutes for short break and 15 minutes for long break.
